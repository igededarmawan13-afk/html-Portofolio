<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a Web Developer with a passion for building clean, 
  responsive, and user-friendly websites. I specialize in turning ideas into functional digital experiences-whether itâ€™s a sleek business site, an interactive web app, or a custom solution tailored to unique needs.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React (and Iâ€™m always exploring new tools to stay ahead). Beyond coding, I focus on creating websites that arenâ€™t just visually appealing, but also fast, accessible, and optimized for performance.</p>

<p>What drives me is solving problems and seeing a project go from concept to launch. I love collaborating with clients and teams, transforming their vision into a digital product that people enjoy using.</p>
<p>When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me learning something new in tech, exploring design trends, or refining side projects that challenge my creativity.</p>
